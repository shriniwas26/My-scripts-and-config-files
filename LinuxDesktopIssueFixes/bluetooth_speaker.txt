Step 1: Automatically connect the bluetooth speaker and enable A2DP sink
Add the following lines to /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf, same as audio.conf in this repo

"""

# Automatically connect both A2DP and HFP/HSP profiles for incoming
# connections. Some headsets that support both profiles will only connect the
# other one automatically so the default setting of true is usually a good
# idea.
AutoConnect=true
# Headset interface specific options (i.e. options which affect how the audio
# service interacts with remote headset devices)
[Headset]
Disable=Headset

"""

Step 2: Direct the sound control to automatically select the correct audio sink
Add the following lines to /etc/pulse/default.pa

"""

### Correct volume binding
